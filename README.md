## Challenge Overview
This module 3 challenge has open eyes and mind to python coding and what it has to offer with its platform. I now see the user friendly syntax and simple use of function words that helps make it an easier reading code format. 

- One of the learning points about python code is the `import` function and variable setup with `os.path.join` makes writing and reading very simple and clean.
