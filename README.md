## Challenge Overview
This module 3 challenge has open eyes and mind to python coding and what it has to offer with its platform. I now see the user friendly syntax and simple use of function words that helps make it an easier reading code format. 

- One of the learning points about python code is the `import` function and variable setup with `os.path.join` makes writing and reading very simple and clean.

- A struggle point for me was the proper `indenting` function which keep myself reviewing why my output data was only part of the return value and slow computing process for end results due print text file opening & closing caused by improper indenting on `loops`. Once the issue were corrected it easy to understand why errors where happen because of the importance to proper indenting.

## Challenge Summary
In all the ups and downs of module 3 it shown me the possibilities with using Python coding, and opened ideas about where this program could help process data from csv files that I currently work with in Reliability Engineering department. I will need to continue to grow my confidence with the new skill set but like anything else will need more hands on practice so the python coding language becomes second hand nature to me.
